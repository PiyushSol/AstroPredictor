# AstroPredictor
This is my Very First Basic Java Program which tells you your astro traits according to the sunsign you entered.
I Have used simple 3 frame windows to give it a app like view . The Image used as one of the frames background is not visible on the jar file
as it is local to my system.
Also as the traits are very  long so the result displayed in the text area in the end is not properly displayed and idented.So it was a problem but moreover the program is very basic.
